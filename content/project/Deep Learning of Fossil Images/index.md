Produced the first large image dataset of fusulinids (2400 images) with the aid of deep learning image segmentation technique (BlendMask)
Developed a combined method of deep learning and multi-view augmentation for efficient fusulinid image identification reaching >90% accuracy on generic level
Conducted advanced morphometric analysis for fusulinid taxonomy and phylogeny
Developing explainable deep learning frameworks to understand how machines “think” when inferencing
