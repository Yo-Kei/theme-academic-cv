abstract: Abstract Fusulinid foraminifera are among the most common microfossils of
  the Late Palaeozoic and act as key fossils for stratigraphic correlation, paleogeographic
  and paleoenvironmental indication, and evolutionary studies of marine life. Accurate
  and efficient identification forms the basis of such research involving fusulinids
  but is limited by the lack of digitized image datasets. This article presents the
  first large image dataset of fusulinids containing 2,400 images of individual samples
  subjected to 16 genera of all six fusulinid families and labelled to species level.
  These images were collected from the literature and our unpublished samples through
  an automatic segmentation procedure implementing BlendMask, a deep learning model.
  The dataset shows promise for the efficient accumulation of fossil images through
  automated procedures and will facilitate taxonomists in future morphologic and systematic
  studies.
