abstract: A uniform, high-resolution geological timescale is essential for studying
  Earth's history, including the dynamics of biodiversity and environmental change.
  Quantitative stratigraphy combines stratigraphic data with statistical and computational
  approaches into a global timescale that allows them to be correlated simultaneously.
  For example, Constrained Optimization (CONOP), built upon Graphic Correlation, sequences
  geological events to generate a composite sequence by resolving inconsistencies
  among stratigraphic records. However, CONOP determines only the global order of
  events (e.g., first or last appearances of species) and cannot assign ages to local
  records, e.g., a locally observed fossil occurrence. Horizon Annealing (HA) addresses
  this by using a simulated annealing algorithm to sequence sampling “horizons” while
  preserving local stratigraphic details. Here, we report HORizon SEquencing (HORSE),
  a generalized and optimized method for HA, with an implementation including parallel
  computing and genetic algorithms to enable fast, automatic stratigraphic correlation
  on large datasets. We evaluate HORSE, HA, and CONOP on three datasets—two empirical
  and one simulated—and assess their performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency,
  and robustness. HORSE greatly outperforms HA in computational efficiency and performs
  comparably to CONOP in event sequencing with greater robustness. Beyond constructing
  high-resolution geological timescales or life histories in deep time, HORSE uniquely
  preserves local stratigraphic information, enabling applications in palaeogeographical
  or palaeoecological studies, as well as evaluations of preservation and sampling
  biases—capabilities not possible with CONOP.
