abstract = {Abstract Identification of fossil species is crucial to evolutionary studies. Recent advances from deep learning have shown promising prospects in fossil image identification. However, the quantity and quality of labelled fossil images are often limited due to fossil preservation, conditioned sampling and expensive and inconsistent label annotation by domain experts, which pose great challenges to training deep learning-based image classification models. To address these challenges, we follow the idea of the wisdom of crowds and propose a multiview ensemble framework, which collects Original (O), Grey (G) and Skeleton (S) views of each fossil image reflecting its different characteristics to train multiple base models, and then makes the final decision via soft voting. Experiments on the largest fusulinid dataset with 2400 images show that the proposed OGS consistently outperforms baselines (using a single model for each view), and obtains superior or comparable performance compared to OOO (using three base models for three the same Original views). Besides, as the training data decreases, the proposed framework achieves more gains. While considering the identification consistency estimation with respect to human experts, OGS receives the highest agreement with the original labels of dataset and with the re-identifications of two human experts. The validation performance provides a quantitative estimation of consistency across different experts and genera. We conclude that the proposed framework can present state-of-the-art performance in the fusulinid fossil identification case study. This framework is designed for general fossil identification and it is expected to see applications to other fossil datasets in future work. Notably, the result, which shows more performance gains as train set size decreases or over a smaller imbalance fossil dataset, suggests the potential application to identify rare fossil images. The proposed framework also demonstrates its potential for assessing and resolving inconsistencies in fossil identification.},

abstract = {Abstract Fusulinid foraminifera are among the most common microfossils of the Late Palaeozoic and act as key fossils for stratigraphic correlation, paleogeographic and paleoenvironmental indication, and evolutionary studies of marine life. Accurate and efficient identification forms the basis of such research involving fusulinids but is limited by the lack of digitized image datasets. This article presents the first large image dataset of fusulinids containing 2,400 images of individual samples subjected to 16 genera of all six fusulinid families and labelled to species level. These images were collected from the literature and our unpublished samples through an automatic segmentation procedure implementing BlendMask, a deep learning model. The dataset shows promise for the efficient accumulation of fossil images through automated procedures and will facilitate taxonomists in future morphologic and systematic studies.},

abstract = {A uniform, high-resolution geological timescale is essential for studying Earth's history, including the dynamics of biodiversity and environmental change. Quantitative stratigraphy combines stratigraphic data with statistical and computational approaches into a global timescale that allows them to be correlated simultaneously. For example, Constrained Optimization (CONOP), built upon Graphic Correlation, sequences geological events to generate a composite sequence by resolving inconsistencies among stratigraphic records. However, CONOP determines only the global order of events (e.g., first or last appearances of species) and cannot assign ages to local records, e.g., a locally observed fossil occurrence. Horizon Annealing (HA) addresses this by using a simulated annealing algorithm to sequence sampling “horizons” while preserving local stratigraphic details. Here, we report HORizon SEquencing (HORSE), a generalized and optimized method for HA, with an implementation including parallel computing and genetic algorithms to enable fast, automatic stratigraphic correlation on large datasets. We evaluate HORSE, HA, and CONOP on three datasets—two empirical and one simulated—and assess their performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. HORSE greatly outperforms HA in computational efficiency and performs comparably to CONOP in event sequencing with greater robustness. Beyond constructing high-resolution geological timescales or life histories in deep time, HORSE uniquely preserves local stratigraphic information, enabling applications in palaeogeographical or palaeoecological studies, as well as evaluations of preservation and sampling biases—capabilities not possible with CONOP.}
